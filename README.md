# üëã Hi, I'm Subha!

üéì **Software Engineering Student @ McMaster University (Class of 2029)**  
üí° I love building things that connect software, hardware, and creativity.


## üß† About Me

I'm an engineering student with a passion for problem-solving, hands-on tech, and turning ideas into real-world solutions. From microcontrollers and sensors to Python scripts and SQL tools, I'm always exploring how technology can be applied in clever, efficient, and meaningful ways.

My journey has involved:

- Teaching kids robotics and programming with Arduino
- Working with sensors, LCDs, buzzers, and embedded systems
- Playing with data through SQL, CSV processing, and visualizations
- Designing smart user interfaces (both CLI and GUI)
- Tackling algorithms, object-oriented programming, and microcontroller I/O logic
