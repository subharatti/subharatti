# 👋 Hi, I'm Subha!

🎓 **Software Engineering Student @ McMaster University (Class of 2029)**  
💡 I love building things that live at the intersection of software, hardware, and creativity.


## 🧠 About Me

I'm an engineering student with a passion for problem-solving, hands-on tech, and turning ideas into real-world solutions. From microcontrollers and sensors to Python scripts and SQL tools, I'm always exploring how technology can be applied in clever, efficient, and meaningful ways.

My journey has involved:

- 👶 Teaching kids robotics and programming with Arduino
- ⚙️ Working with sensors, LCDs, buzzers, and embedded systems
- 💾 Playing with data through SQL, CSV processing, and visualizations
- 🎨 Designing smart user interfaces — both CLI and GUI
- 🧠 Tackling algorithms, object-oriented programming, and microcontroller I/O logic
